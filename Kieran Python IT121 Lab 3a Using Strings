#The following code is a test of the different uses of strings and their syntax.
#The following will be accomplished;

#   - double quotes
string1 = "Hello Mike!"
print(string1)
print()

#   - single quotes
string1 = 'Hello Mike! (but with single quotes this time)'
print(string1)
print()

#   - triple quotes
string1 = '''Kieran said "Hello Mike!" when he saw his professor at school.'''
print(string1)
print()

#   - backslash escape for special characters like apostrophes
string1 = 'Kieran\'s time in programming wasn\'t as scary as he\'d thought.'
print(string1)
print()

#   - multiple embedded values using %s, %d, and %f
string1 = "I can count with letters! %s %d %.1f!"
string2 = "0"
dec = 1.0
floating = 2.0
print(string1 % (string2,dec,floating))
print()

#   - multiplying strings
string1 = "Hello Mike! "
dec=int(input("How many \"Hello\"\'s would you like?!"))
print(string1*dec)
print()

#   - removing the newline of a print statement with end=""
string1 = "Hello Mike! "
print(string1, end="")
print(string1, end="")
print(string1, end="")
print(string1, end="")
print(string1)
print()

#   - adding newlines to print statements
string1 = "H\ne\nl\nl\no\n \nM\ni\nk\ne\n!"
print(string1)
print()
