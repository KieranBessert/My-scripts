// This program takes its input from a file of numbers of type int and calculates the total number of values, 
// the average of all numbers(as a double),
// and finally finds the Min/Max/Avg number in the file and then writes these to the screen and as an output file.

Your output to the screen will have appropriate text to indicate what the values are,

Input file contains 26 values
The smallest value is -4
The largest value is 165
The average of all the values is 74.32

Print your average with 2 decimal places and the other values as integers as shown above.
