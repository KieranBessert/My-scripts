/*
Using an array, 
write a program that takes its input from a file of numbers of type int 
and then sorts the numbers from lowest to highest 
and then writes the sorted values to a separate output file. 

Also have your program write to the screen the total number of values read 
as well as the highest, lowest, and average of the numbers read. 

Do not write these to your output file and do not write the sorted list to the screen. 
Use the selection sort method described in section 7.3 of the text. 
See the selection sort explanation in the Videos module to understand how the sort works. 

The input file contains nothing but numbers of type int separated by blanks or line breaks. 
Your output file should contain nothing except the numbers from the input file, but now sorted.  
I will provide a sample input file for your testing use.  
You may assume that I will not test your program with an input file containing more than 50 numbers.

Name your input file "unsorted.txt" and your output file "sorted.txt" and use relative paths 
(so your input file will be located in your solution folder).
