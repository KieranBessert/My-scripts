Airbnb has to translate each amenity into as many languages as it can in order to provide their services across multiple geographic regions. In order to do this, each amenity is assigned an English translation and served up to us when we view the site in English. When we see things like `translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49`, that implies that there is some amenity for which there is no suitable translation."

This function should take in a **single parsed listing** and output either \"True\" or \"False\".
