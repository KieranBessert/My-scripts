// This program accepts a number of cents from the user (positive integer in the range of 0 to 1,000) and 
// outputs the smallest number of coins made up of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies that equal the value of total cents specified.

/*
Pseudocode;
Ask user for how many cents they have and store in variable?
check if this is a valid entry

how many quarters can we return?
how many dimes can we return?
how many nickles can we return?
can we return any pennies?

Tell the user total coins returned
