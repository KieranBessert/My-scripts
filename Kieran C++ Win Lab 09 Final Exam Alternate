/*
Write a program to calculate final grades for a list of students. 
Each student has 5 quizzes that count for 25% of the final average, 
4 labs that count for 35% of the final average, 
a midterm exam that counts for 20% of the final average, 
and a final exam that counts for 20% of the average.  
See the example below for a sample input file.

Your program will read in all data from a text file and calculate the 
numeric average for each student and then assign a letter grade for each student.  
For simplicity, we will use the standard 10 point scale with 90+ assigned an A,
80 to less than 90 a B, and so on.  
Calculate your averages to 2 decimal places.  
All input scores will be on a 100 point scale and will be given in the file as integers 
(although you may read them in as something else if desired).  
Each row of the input file will contain data for one student, 
consisting of the student's first and last name, 
followed by the 5 quizzes, 
the 4 labs, 
the midterm score, 
and the final exam score, 
with one or more spaces between items. 
You may assume that there are no errors in the input file.

Your program will output the following to the screen:
a well-aligned table consisting of student first name, 
last name, final average, letter grade

Your program will write the following to an output file:
a well-aligned table consisting of student first name, 
last name, 
all scores from the input file in the correct order followed by the final average and letter grade.

Both your screen output and file output should have appropriate column headings.

There will not be more than 25 students.  
You must use an array of structs to hold the student information. 
Do not use any data structures that have not been covered in this class. 
Your program should be written in a way such that you could 
easily adjust the number of quizzes and/or labs.  
Use relative paths and name your input file "input.txt" and your output file "output.txt".  
Be sure to include error checking on the opening of the files. 
Include at least one function.

sample input:

Bob Smith 100 90 95 70 63 100 100 90 85 65 85
Sue Jones 70 85 73 0 52 90 80 76 83 70 56

sample  screen  output:

First Name       Last Name               Average        Grade
Bob                    Smith                            83.71          B
Sue                    Jones                            67.99          D
